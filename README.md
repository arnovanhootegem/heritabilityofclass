R scripts for paper on the Heritability of Class and Status by Arno Van Hootegem, Adrian Farner Rogne & Torkild Hovde Lyngstad

# My R Scripts

This repository contains a collection of R scripts I've made for the paper "Heritability of Class and Status", written by Arno Van Hootegem, Adrian Farner Rogne and Torkild Hovde Lyngstad. 
It constructs class schemes (EGP, SIOPS, ISEI, Oesch and ORDC) based on Norwegian registry data, which are then analysed using twin models (metric, ordinal and binary) to estimate the heritability of class.

# Scripts

- `Data preperation.R`: Prepares and merges data that is used for the analysis
- `Coding Class schemes.R`: Codes all of the class schemes needed for the analyses
- `Twin analyses.R`: Conducts all metric, ordinal and binary twin analyses
- `Descriptives.R`: Generates descriptive statistics for the full population, monozygotic and dizygotic twins

# Data

Norwegian privacy regulations limit our ability to share our register data. 
Individual researchers may apply to obtain permissions and subsequently access the data.
